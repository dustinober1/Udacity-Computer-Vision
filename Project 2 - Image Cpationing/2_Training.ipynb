    "\n",

    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The CNN-RNN architecture consists of two main components: the CNN-based encoder and the LSTM-based decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "The encoder is implemented as an instance of the EncoderCNN class. It uses a pre-trained ResNet-50 model as the backbone to extract features from input images. The last fully connected layer of ResNet-50 is removed and replaced with a linear layer to reduce the output size to embed_size. The final feature representation is obtained by applying the linear layer to the flattened features tensor. The forward method takes in the images tensor as input and returns the extracted features tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decoder is implemented as an instance of the DecoderRNN class. It takes in the extracted features tensor from the encoder and the captions tensor as input. The captions tensor is first embedded using an embedding layer that maps word indices to their embeddings. The embedded features tensor and the embedded captions tensor are then concatenated and fed into an LSTM that takes in the embedded word vectors as input and outputs hidden states at each time step. The final output scores are obtained by applying a linear layer to the hidden states. The forward method takes in the features and captions tensors as input and returns the output scores tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample method is used to generate predicted sentences given a pre-processed input image tensor. It takes in the pre-processed input image tensor, initial hidden state of the LSTM, and the maximum length of the predicted sentence as input. The method uses the LSTM to generate the predicted word indices for the output sentence. It repeatedly feeds the predicted word embeddings back into the LSTM until the maximum length is reached or the EOS token is predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The transform_train is used to apply data augmentation and preprocessing techniques on the training images before passing them to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- RandomCrop: randomly crops the image to a specified size (224x224 pixels)\n",
    "- RandomHorizontalFlip: flips the image horizontally with a probability of 0.5\n",
    "- ToTensor: converts the image to a PyTorch tensor\n",
    "- Normalize: normalizes the image with the mean and standard deviation of the ImageNet dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "These transforms are commonly used in image classification tasks and are considered to be a good choice for training CNN models. The RandomCrop and RandomHorizontalFlip transforms help increase the variability of the training data and improve the model's ability to generalize to new images. The ToTensor transform converts the image to a tensor, which is the expected input format for the CNN model. Finally, the Normalize transform scales the pixel values to have a mean of [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and a standard deviation of [0.229, 0.224, 0.225], which are the mean and standard deviation of the ImageNet dataset. This normalization step helps the model converge faster during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the transform_train provided in the code is a good choice for the CNN architecture because it applies a set of common image preprocessing and augmentation techniques that have been shown to be effective for training CNNs on image classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "In the encoder part of the architecture, I loaded a pre-trained ResNet-50 model and disabled learning for all parameters in the backbone by setting param.requires_grad_(False). This is a common practice in transfer learning where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on a specific task. Since the ResNet-50 model was trained on ImageNet dataset, it has already learned to recognize and extract high-level features from images. By disabling the learning of these parameters, we ensure that the already learned features are preserved, and we only need to learn the new linear layer that reduces the output size to embed_size.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the decoder part of the architecture, we have three trainable parameters: embed, lstm, and linear. The embed layer maps word indices to their embeddings, which are then passed to the lstm layer. The lstm layer takes in the embedded word vectors as input and outputs hidden states at each time step. Finally, the linear layer maps the hidden states to the vocabulary size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of these trainable parameters is based on the architecture of the LSTM-based image captioning model. The embed layer is used to learn the embeddings of the input captions, while the lstm layer is used to learn the temporal dependencies between the input embeddings and generate the output sequence. The linear layer is used to map the hidden states to the vocabulary size, allowing the model to generate a probability distribution over the vocabulary at each time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these trainable parameters are a good choice because they allow the model to learn the appropriate representations for the input images and captions, and to generate meaningful and accurate captions for the input images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "For this implementation, I used the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. Adam is a popular optimizer for deep learning models and has shown good performance in a variety of tasks. It is a combination of momentum and RMSprop, and it uses adaptive learning rates for each parameter, making it suitable for models with large datasets and complex architectures. The learning rate of 0.001 was chosen based on trial and error, and it worked well for this particular implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> UPDATE </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial optimizer parameters had to be changed because the system kept timing out. I had to modify the optimizer in order to complete the assignment."

For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",

In the next (optional) step of this notebook, we provide some guidance for assessing the performance on the validation dataset."

    "## Step 3: (Optional) Validate your Model\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
